I havent powered it the way I should have, But thanks to the extra effective ready-made tutorials, atleast I am getting the hang of it. With more time, I will surely boom. Thanks to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
You know what? I do like to learn a lot but I take too much time to do it.. I wish I could be better.
