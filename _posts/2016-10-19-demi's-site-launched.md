I havent powered it the way I should have, But thanks to the extra effective ready-made tutorials, atleast I am getting the hang of it. With more time, I will surely boom. Thanks to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
You know what? I do like to learn a lot but I take too much time to do it.. I wish I could be better at things. 
Okay, cutting all these craps let me tell you why did I really made this blog? I mean everbody does now, you can say that. But there's more to it. I think I owe my life to this process of life and death, my biological parents (ofcourse), my teachers, my friends, my <b>acquiantances</b>, my favorite kadamba tree and my black street dog (It doesnt have a fixed name, depends on my mood).<br/><br/> Ahh..if I consider everything then, I would love to say I want to explore more. This blog is not basically to sell myself, but to let you know that I exist. I am sure most other bloggers will agree with me on this point. Now, as I have the freedom of this free-space and the source hub called internet, I will not stop giving a buzz! Don't worry I won't irritate you but trust me, these blogs will somewhere give you a chance to free your mind or a chance to explore the world without roaring your engines. I live, live with many people and sometimes I live alone. BUT things I get to see, get to learn is basically something that upgrades me. Beating around the bush?

<h1>Straight Forward - What will you get to know about?</h1>

<ul><li>The Demi you know or don't know</li>
<li> My work - My educational experience </li>
<li> Product Reviews </li>
<li> Book Reviews </li></ul>

That's all.. I won't eat your head much and you know I don't like to share too-much. But I need a place to throw all of the mini-Demi insights and talks that irritate me. Internet is the best place. You can read, like Harry used to see Dumbledor's memory, but it's definitely upto you. Adios!
