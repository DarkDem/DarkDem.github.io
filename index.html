	<h1>This is Demi</h1>
	<p>I am an ordinary human with a crazy taste for anime, 
	STEM and basically all colorful hotchpotch of occurences aka patterns. 
	I am an Electrical Engineering PhD student and an active student member
	of International Society for Optics and Photonics (SPIE). 
	Most of my time is well spent behind my laptop or that's what I like to believe.
	My idea of fun includes painting,solving rubik's cube, 
	listening to different genres of music, reading and writing.
