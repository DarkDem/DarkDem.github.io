	<h1>This is Demi</h1>
	<p>What? Paragraph on what? Me? I ... Am Demi, a learner, a reseracher, a diver, a coder, an orator, what else - a music lover, a painter, an avid reader and purely a hobyist
         . Basically I do everything except doing justice to my academics and probably, I am one of the most unruly and unconventional person you 
         will ever meet, still I am not interesting to talk about. Although I don't really like much of the things hapening in my institution, I do like like the concept of education.
	 While you can see my work as a science communicator many times, I prefer to post the real scenes I get from my teams's outreach
	 programs. I love each and everyday of my life because it is not stagnant. I get to tinker with loads of stuffs in daily basis and
	 I prefer to give an update about all of them <br/><br/>
	
	 I have found out that I have kept an About section for stating things about me. While I prefer to talk about me in that section I do 
         want to keep this as the Home for updates and day-to-day progress. However, the work of drafting an about section is still on progress. 
	 I want to merge the CV section with About too as otherwise so many different sections dont really sync. Let's keep it simple, it 
	 anyway irritates me to talk without meaning!
