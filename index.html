	<h1>This is Demi</h1>
	<p>I am an ordinary human with a crazy taste for anime, 
	STEM and basically all colorful hotchpotch of occurences aka patterns. By profession,
	I am an Electrical Engineer, a 1st year PhD student and a member
	of International Society for Optics and Photonics (SPIE). My research interest
	revolves around nonlinear optics and chaos theory. Some day, I intend to portray an intermixing
	of both these world into my thesis. Most of my time is well-spent behind my laptop or
	that's what I like to believe. My idea of fun includes painting, solving rubik's cube, 
	listening to different genres of music, reading and writing. Oh, and I am not pronoun sensitive, you can 
	use either one or all of them.
